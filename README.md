# macroteoria

Jupyter notebooks and codes for graduate macro taught in semester one at the RSE end of the Econ world.

Materials are ordered by the number of the *week* in which they are introduced. 

For assessable tutorial problems, these are labeled with a prefix **T** and indexed by the week in which the material is taught. For example, a
tutorial  problem set **T***02* is to be 

* completed by the end of Week 2, 
* submitted at the start of Week 3, and,
* its solutions are discussed afterwards in class in Week 3 after submission closes.
